                    OK, OK now for the real deal.  I was born, raised
                    and most likely, will die in Augusta, GA.  I attended
                    Westside High School, Augusta College (yes,
                    it's still called that in my world), and the Clubhou.se's Code Boot Camp.
            <br /> <br />
                    I have worked for 4 companies in my career, so job hopping
                    is not an issue for me.
            <br /> <br />
                    The first was the Medical College of Georgia (yes, it's still
                    called that in my world), CallingPost.com, SRNS,
                    and Macuch Steel.
