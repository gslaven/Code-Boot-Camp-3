          <br /> <br />
            OK, OK now for the real deal.  I was born, raised
            and most likely, will die in Augusta, GA.  I attended
            Westside High School, Augusta College (yes, it"s still
            called that in my world), and the Clubhou.se"s Code Boot Camp.
          <br /> <br />
            I have worked for 4 companies in my career, so job hopping
            is not an issue for me.
          <br /> <br />
            The first was the Medical College of Georgia (yes, it"s still
                called that in my world), CallingPost.com, SRNS,
                and Macuch Steel.
