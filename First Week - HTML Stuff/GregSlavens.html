			"I was born a poor bla... wait a minute, I think that"s
			from the movie "The Jerk"!?
			<br>	<br>
			OK, OK now for the real deal.  I was born, raised
			and most likely, will die in Augusta, GA.  I attended
			Westside High School, Augusta College (yes, it"s still
			called that in my world), and the Clobhou.se"s Code Boot Camp.
			<br>	<br>
			I have worked for 4 companies in my career, so job hopping
			is not an issue for me.
			<br>	<br>
			The first was the Medical College of Georgia (yes, it"s still
			called that in my world), CallingPost.com, SRNS,
			and Macuch Steel.
